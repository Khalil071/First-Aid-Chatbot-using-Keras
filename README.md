First Aid Chatbot using Keras

📌 Project Overview

This project develops an AI-powered First Aid Chatbot using deep learning models trained with Keras. The chatbot provides immediate assistance and guidance on first aid practices for various emergencies.

📂 Dataset Information

The dataset consists of predefined first aid queries and responses, including:

Common emergencies (e.g., burns, choking, bleeding, fractures, CPR, etc.).

Symptoms and first aid steps.

General health-related inquiries.

🛠️ Technologies Used

Python for scripting

TensorFlow & Keras for building the chatbot model

NLTK & SpaCy for natural language processing (NLP)

NumPy & Pandas for data handling

Flask or FastAPI for chatbot deployment

🔍 Key Steps in Development

1️⃣ Data Preprocessing

Cleaning and tokenizing text data.

Converting text into sequences using Keras Tokenizer.

Padding sequences for consistent input length.

2️⃣ Model Development

Building a deep learning model using LSTMs (Long Short-Term Memory) or Transformers.

Training the model on first aid responses.

Using categorical cross-entropy for classification.

3️⃣ Training and Evaluation

Training the model with preprocessed text data.

Evaluating the chatbot's response accuracy.

Optimizing hyperparameters for better performance.

4️⃣ Chatbot Deployment

Creating an API using Flask or FastAPI.

Developing a simple web or mobile UI for chatbot interaction.

📈 Example Usage

User: "How do I treat a minor burn?"Chatbot: "Cool the burn with running water for 10-15 minutes. Cover it with a clean, dry cloth. Avoid ice or butter."

🚀 How to Run the Project

1️⃣ Install Dependencies
